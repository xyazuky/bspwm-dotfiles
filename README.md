# Why?
I wanted to try an x11 wm. I din't had a good experience with wayland, so currently im just trying to learn and just experiment with different stuff. 

The main color palette is inspired in [Gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material)
## Dependencies

### Main Font
The primary font used in this configuration is [FiraCode Nerd](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/ttf-firacode-nerd/). While you can use any font you prefer, please note that emojis, such as the ones in polybar, needs this font.

Also, for japanese font in polybar, you need any japanese font. I use [noto-fonts-cjk](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/noto-fonts-cjk/)

### Additional Dependencies
For picom i use [picom FT-Labs](https://github.com/FT-Labs/picom) fork, The animations are really smooth but i have some problems while using glx (It still works tho)
